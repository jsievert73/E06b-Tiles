Playing with the Tiled Map Editor

 This project uses the tiled map editor found at [https://www.mapeditor.org](https://www.mapeditor.org)

 This project is a simple 2D platformer where you can jump around and collect "coins" to get points. There is no clear end, but it was simply an opportunity to play with the tiled program and figure out how it works on a very basic level.
